Consider the example : 

unsigned long new_time;
unsigned long start_time;

const int TIMER = 180;    // This case does NOT work and the eqution never became true
if ( (new_time-start_time) >= (1000*TIMER)) 


const unsigned long = 180 // This case works and the equation becomes true after 180 seconds
if ( (new_time-start_time) >= (1000*TIMER)) 

OR 

const unsigned long = 180000 // This case works and the equation becomes true after 180 seconds
if ( (new_time-start_time) >= TIMER)  // removed the multiplication operation
