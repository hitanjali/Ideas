THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS MARKEING 
BEST PRODUCT WILL BE EATING DUST WITHOUT MARKETING AND EVEN AN AVERAGET PRODUCT CAN BE SOLD WITH GOOD MARKETING


1. How to handle the markteting / sales ? 

2. Get ready with the first prodcut : 
	2.1 laser printer                          : Done
	2.2 component required                     
		a. Mass procurement and rates      : Pending
	2.3 PCB manifacturing 
		a. PCB design                      : Done
		b. PCB printing/milling            : Pending
		   
		   NOTE : Do we want the product to be OPEN SOURCE ? 
		
	2.4 Assembling 
	2.5 Casing 
		a. Contact custom case maker       : Done
		   The custom case MOQ             : 5000 units
		   The die cost comes around       : 1.5L
		   MOQ after the die is made       : 1000-1500
		   
		   NOTE : Holes etc modification in the general box doable at MOQ of 1000-1500 at Rs. 2/3 per box. 
		          The holes will be done in the box with drill machine and not CNC. 
			  CNC generates heat and may cause the material to melt. 
			  We can ask have the cuts/ holes be done locally. 


		   NOTE : Seems that we can go with the available box. 

		b. Fitting in the available box    : Pending 

	2.6 Final costing of the prodcut           : Pending


3. Preapre the NodeMCU the complete solution : 
   
   As suggested by Nilesh that we will not have a WiFi Connection in the places , 

   a. We can either use wired transmission of information. To the next node. And then club both node inforamtion for the next node. 

   b. Creat a mesh network of our own devices and one of the node communicates with the router that would publish the information. 

   c. which needs to have the ESP-01 configured as Soft AP and communicate with other ESP-01 to create mesh. 


   OR Use the RF transcivers and generate your own network with RF communication. 

      The use of low freq. RF transcivers requires big antenna. 



4. As talked with  Nilesh Shah : 

	Fire safety solution for the entire community : 

	We can have the Annual Maintenance and Monitoring taken up. So that the regular income comes in. 
	He suggested to have a big ticket item so that the earning will also be more. 
	Like the project cost should be more or on a bigger scale like entire apartment or community etc. 
	Data logging items for factories like rejection in a conveyor belt. He talked about Bislery water bottling would have some rejection. 
	But that data should be logged on and sent to the relevant person for analysis or monitoring. 
	
	If you go for some industry solutions you may get good amount of margin. 
	In consumer goods / small ticket items there will be many players and people would copy your solution and work. 

	He suggested not to invest time in software side and just concentrate on the hardware and new product markets. 


	He said WiFi would not be there every where in the apartment or industry where you would like to install the product. 
	So you may want to carry the signals to the next node ? 
 


5. Market Survey for the new product :
